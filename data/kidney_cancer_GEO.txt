27. The epithelial splicing regulator ESRP2 is epigenetically repressed by DNA hypermethylation in Wilms tumor and acts as a tumor suppressor 
(Submitter supplied) Wilms tumor (WT), a childhood kidney cancer with embryonal origins, has been extensively characterised for genetic and epigenetic alterations, but a proportion of WTs still lack identifiable abnormalities.  To uncover DNA methylation changes critical for WT pathogenesis, we compared the epigenome of fetal kidney with two WT cell lines, using methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation.  We filtered our results to remove common cancer-associated epigenetic changes, and to enrich for genes involved in early kidney development.  This identified four candidate genes that were hypermethylated in WT cell lines compared to fetal kidney, of which ESRP2 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2), was the most promising gene for further study.  ESRP2 was commonly repressed by DNA methylation early in WT development (in nephrogenic rests) and could be reactivated by DNA methyltransferase inhibition in WT cell lines.  When ESRP2 was expressed in WT cell lines, it acted as an inhibitor of cellular proliferation in vitro and in vivo it suppressed tumor growth of orthotopic xenografts in nude mice.  RNA-seq of the ESRP2-expressing WT cell lines identified several novel splicing targets, in addition to well-characterised targets of ESRP2.  One of these targets, LEF1, is a component of the Wnt signalling pathway that is essential for kidney development and commonly disrupted in WT.  We propose a model in which the Wnt pathway can be disrupted in early kidney development to generate WT, either by genetic abnormalities such as WT1 mutations, or by epigenetic defects, such as ESRP2 methylation.

45. Activation of the Mitochondrial Stress Response in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Kidneys from our transgenic mouse model of early stage cancer of the kidney (TRACK) exhibit a mitochondrial stress response (MSR) signature, as indicated by increased mRNA for Atf4, a key transcription factor activated in the MSR, and increased transcripts of Atf4 targets, including Asns, Mthfd2, Trib3, Ddit3(Chop;Gadd153), Atf3, Ppp1r15a(Gadd34), Aldh1l2, Fgf21, and Slc20a1. By performing transcriptomics analyses from TRACK versus wild type (WT) kidneys after dietary vitamin A deprivation, we show that both vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and expression of constitutively active HIF1α intensify the MSR, redirect amino acids to one carbon metabolism, and facilitate the biosynthesis of reduced glutathione.

56. DNA Demethylation promotes ERV expression and activation of immune signaling in renal cell cancer cells
(Submitter supplied) Recently, we reported that expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), a class of transposable element, is associated with response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Aberrant expression of ERVs can activate host antiviral responses, as well as produce neoantigens. ERV expression is repressed by DNA methylation and can be activated by DNA hypomethylating agents. Here, we investigate whether Decitabine, a DNA hypomethylating agent, can activate ERV expression and host antiviral defenses in RCC to potentially enhance response to ICB. more...

(Submitter supplied) We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and deep analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes (scTCR-seq) in cancer patients across several indications, assessing the profiles of TCRs in the various populations of T cells in tumours, normal adjacent tissue (NAT), and peripheral blood.  In a subset of patients, we find clear evidence of clonotypic expansion of T effector-like cells not only within the tumour but also in NAT.

105. Ex vivo expanded human 3D Nephrospheres engraft long term and repair chronic renal injury in mice
(Submitter supplied) End-stage renal disease is a worldwide epidemic requiring renal replacement therapy. Harvesting tissue from failing kidneys and autotransplantation of expanded committed progenitors giving rise to renal parenchyma could theoretically allow for the restoration of kidney function delaying or preventing the need for dialysis or a renal allograft. Here we utilized healthy and end-stage human adult kidneys to robustly expand proliferative kidney epithelial cells and establish 3D-kidney epithelial cultures termed nephrospheres (nSPH). more...

139. Ascorbic acid–induced TET activation mitigates adverse hydroxymethylcystosine loss in renal cell carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Although clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has been shown to result in widespread aberrant cytosine methylation and loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), the prognostic impact and therapeutic targeting of tis epigenetic aberrancy has not been fully explored. Analysis of 576 primary ccRCC samples demonstrated that loss of 5hmC was significantly associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and was an independent adverse prognostic factor. more...

146. An EZH2-FBP1 Feedback Circuitry Promotes Tumorigenesis in Gluconeogenic Tissues
(Submitter supplied) We report that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) represses the expression of a rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1, 6 -bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) to promote tumorigenesis. More intriguingly, FBP1 inhibits EZH2 methyltransferase activity by binding EZH2 at targeted loci and dissembles the polycomb complex, which constitutes a negative feedback loop for EZH2-initiated signalings. We performed ChIP-Seq assays using the EZH2 and H3K27me3 antibody in HCC cells with vector control, FBP1 wild-type (WT) or FBP1 S169A re-expression. more...

178. Gene Expression Profiling of SPOP Knocked Down Cell
(Submitter supplied) SPOP is one of the most frequent mutated genes in prostate cancer. In the current study, we identified CCNE1 as its substrate. SPOP directly interacts with CCNE1, poly-ubiquitinates CCNE1 in vivo and in vitro, and represses cancer-related phenotypes induced by CCNE1 expression. Thus, we reveal a new mechanism for SPOP in repressing prostate cancer tumorigenesis.

204. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling of renal cell carcinoma and matched normal kidney tubules [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) We generated primary cultures from renal cell carcinoma and matched normal primary kidney cortex tubule cell cultures from 3 patients. Early passage cultures of these two cell types were subjected to chromatin accessibility profiling (DNase-seq) and gene expression profiling (RNA-seq). Studying these paired and patient-matched controlled data sets will shed light on the epigenomic changes that underlie transformation of kidney tubules into malignant cancers.

205. VHL Substrate Transcription Factor ZHX2 As An Oncogenic Driver In Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase protein is a hallmark of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Identifying how pathways affected by VHL loss contribute to ccRCC remains challenging. We used a genome-wide in vitro expression strategy to identify proteins that bound VHL only when hydroxylated. Zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) was found as a VHL target and its hydroxylation allowed VHL to regulate its protein stability. more...

DIS3L2 is an exoribonuclease with a demonstrated preference for 3’-uridylated RNA substrates.  However, its targets relevant to human disease are poorly understood.  Our goal was to address transcriptomic changes in DIS3L2 deficient mouse nephron progenitor cells, a cell type of the developing kidney with demonstrated relevance to Wilms tumorigenesis. more...

208. H3.3K27M mutant proteins reprogram epigenome by sequestering the PRC2 complex to poised enhancers
(Submitter supplied) Expression of histone H3.3K27M mutant proteins in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) results in a global reduction of tri-methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3), and paradoxically, H3K27me3 peaks remain at hundreds of genomic loci, a dichotomous change that lacks mechanistic insights. Here we show that the PRC2 complex is sequestered at poised enhancers, but not at active promoters with high levels of H3.3K27M proteins, thereby contributing to the global reduction of H3K27me3. more...

In this study, we identified that low TGFBR3 expression in ccRCC cells enhanced primary tumor formation and lung metastasis. In the presence of TGFBR3, TGF-b2 decreased the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive ccRCC cell population, in which renal cancer-initiating cells are enriched. more...

Here we used an unbiased gene expression profiling approach and identified a novel mechanism of conventional chemotherapy that explains how the cure of these patients is brought about. Transcription profiling of an untreated WT1 mutant Wilms tumor (Wilms10) and a corresponding lung metastasis that was detected after long-term chemotherapy, revealed the induction of a myogenic transcriptional network with concomitant down-regulation of cell cycle genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) The multi-kinase inhibitor drug sorafenib is used as first line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. Sorafenib mainly undergos cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated oxidation and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A9-mediated glucuronidation in liver, but the biotransformation of sorafenib in kidney remains unclear. Therefore, we integrated the mRNA expression data of 36 kidney samples and the corresponding metabolic activities for sorafenib to study the metabolic mechanism of sorafenib in kidney.

240. Microarray expression profiling of dysregulated mRNAs between ccRCC tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues
(Submitter supplied) Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common and lethal cancer of the adult kidney. Its incidence is increasing and outcomes remain poor. Accurate discrimination of RCC patients with poor prognosis was very important for the appropriate and effective patient management. ccRCC originated from dysregulation of different gene expression. To screen novel prognosis markers, a dysregulated mRNA expression profile was identified by microarray in some pairs of different stages ccRCC.

253. Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR promotes cell migration by upregulating insulin growth factor-binding protein 2 in renal cell carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most lethal urologic cancers. About one-third of RCC patients already have distal metastasis at the time of diagnosis. There is growing evidence that Hox antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) plays essential roles in metastasis in several types of cancers. However, the precise mechanism by which HOTAIR enhances malignancy remains unclear, especially in RCC. Here, we demonstrated that HOTAIR enhances RCC-cell migration by regulating the insulin growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) expression. more...

385. Oviductal expression data from wild type and Wt1 heterozygous mice
(Submitter supplied) Comparison of gene expression in wild type and Wt1 (Wilms tumor suppressor gene 1) heterozygous knockout mice. Background: in Wt1+/- mice (MF1 strain) litter sizes are significantly smaller than in wild type animals. In addition, we observe retarded embryonic development of pre-implantation embryos that are still within the oviduct. By gene expression analysis we want to elucidate the molecular basis for these phenomena.

386. Epigenetic Inactivation of the Putative DNA/RNA Helicase SLFN11 in Human Cancer Confers Resistance to Platinum-derived Drugs
(Submitter supplied) Platinum-derived drugs such as cisplatin and carboplatin are among the most commonly used cancer chemotherapy drugs, but very few specific molecular and cellular markers to predict different sentivity to these agents in a given tumor type have been clearly identified. Because epigenetic gene silencing is increasingly being recognized as a factor in conferring distinct tumoral drug sensitivity, we have used a comprehensive DNA methylation microarray platform to interrogate the widely characterized NCI60 panel of human cancer cell lines according to CpG methylation status and cisplatin/carboplatin sensitivity. more...

387. Pervasive transcription read-through promotes aberrant expression of oncogenes and RNA chimeras in renal carcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Aberrant expression of cancer genes and non-canonical RNA species is a hallmark of cancer. However, the mechanisms driving such atypical gene expression programs are incompletely understood. Here, our transcriptional profiling of a cohort of 50 primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that transcription read-through beyond the termination site is a source of transcriptome diversity in cancer cells. more...

388. Loss of histone demethylase JARID1C triggers genomic instability in cancer.
(Submitter supplied) Chromatin remodelers are recurrently mutated in cancer. Among these, JARID1C, (KDM5C) a histone demethylase, is frequently inactivated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. How the genetic inactivation of JARID1C leads to cancer remains largely unknown. Here we report that JARID1C binds to broad chromatin domains characterized by the trimethylation of lysine 9 (H3K9me3), an histone mark enriched in heterochromatin. more...

We profiles DNA methylation across cell line models of SETD2 inactivation and SETD2 mutated primary tumors as this epigenetic mark is linked to H3K36me3 and is a targetable mark for cancer therapy. SETD2 depleted cell line models (long-term and acute) exhibited a hypermethylation phenotype coinciding with ectopic gains in H3K36me3 centered across intergenic regions adjacent to low expression genes that became upregulated with dysregulation of the epigenome. more...

(Submitter supplied) Clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) accounts for >80% of all kidney cancers but what triggers the tumorigenesis in the kidney and metastases in the bones are still under debate. Our hypothesis is that remodeling of the genomic fabrics of certain functional pathways and their interplay beyond critical limits are key causes of CCRC. We profiled the transcriptomes of metastatic chest wall and of two primary cancerous sites of the renal medulla and compared them with that of non-cancerous kidney resection margins. more...

(Submitter supplied) Tumor-specific alternative splicing is implicated in the progression of cancer, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using ccRCC RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found that epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (ESRP2), one of the key regulators of alternative splicing in epithelial cells, is expressed in ccRCC. ESRP2 mRNA expression did not correlate with the overall survival rate of ccRCC patients, but the expression of some ESRP-target exons correlated with the good prognosis and with the expression of Arkadia (also known as RNF111) in ccRCC. more...

(Submitter supplied) Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a distinct group of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) that silence transposable genetic elements to protect genome integrity. Due to their limited expression in gonads and sequence diversity, piRNAs remain the most mysterious class of small RNAs. Studies have shown piRNAs are present in somatic cells and dysregulated in gastric, breast and liver cancers. By deep sequencing 24 frozen benign kidney and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) specimens and using the publically available piRNA database, we found 26,991 piRNAs present in human kidney tissue. more...

402. Heterogeneous effects of massive hypoxia pathway activation in kidney cancer
(Submitter supplied) General activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways is classically associated with adverse prognosis in cancer and has been proposed to contribute to oncogenic drive. In clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC) HIF pathways are upregulated by inactivation of the von-Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor. However HIF-1a and HIF-2a have contrasting effects on experimental tumour progression. To better understand this paradox we examined pan-genomic patterns of HIF DNA binding and associated gene expression in response to manipulation of HIF-1a and HIF-2a and related the findings to CCRC prognosis. more...

We provide evidence that human SLFN5, an interferon (IFN)-  inducible member of the family, exhibits key roles in controlling motility and  invasiveness of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. Our studies define the mechanism by  which this occurs, demonstrating that SLFN5 negatively controls expression of matrix  metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 and -13 and several other genes involved in the control of  malignant cell motility. more...

447. The gene expression profile of renal cell carcinoma cell line (786-O) versus prostate cancer cell line (PC3) in co-culture with primary murine muscle progenitor cells
(Submitter supplied) Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have a life expectancy of 6 months to 1 year. The deadly nature of RCC compared to other tumors that metastasize to bone, such as prostate cancer (PC), is associated with extensive arteriogenesis that requires recruitment of muscle progenitor cells to form the vascular smooth muscle around these large vessels. To identify potential genes that are involved in RCC recruitment of muscle progenitor cells we performed a microarray analysis to evaluate the global gene expression of human RCC (786-O) cells that form these large vessels in murine xenografts, versus human PC (PC3) that do not form these large vessels during osteolytic bone metastasis in mice (Xie C, et al. more...

(Submitter supplied) Developing strategies to overcome the frequent resistance to VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors in patients is a major challenge in antiangiogenic therapy for cancer. Targeting the VEGF pathway in vivo induces hypoxia and therefore enables to study drug-induced hypoxia in tumors. Hypoxia also occurs in the spontaneous evolution of cancers, particularly around areas of necrosis.  Using cell markers such as CD133, CXCR4, or ALDH1, we identified stem-like cells in peri-necrotic areas in human biopsies and xenografts models of renal cancers. more...

453. Genome-wide analysis of WT1-controlled gene expression in podocytes
(Submitter supplied) We identified binding sites of the Wilms' tumor suppressor protein WT1 in the mouse podocyte genome in vivo by ChIP-seq. Furthermore, we provide a podocyte transcriptome derived from primary podocytes that were isolated by FACS on mouse glomeruli. In short, we show that WT1 activates a highly specific podocyte transcriptome by binding to putative podocyte-specific enhancers and TSS of target genes. Genes bound by WT1 in podocytes include the majority of genes mutated in hereditary podocytopathies as well as components of the slit diaphragm, actin cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and within endocytosis pathways. Furthermore, we infer a podocyte TF network from DNA-binding motifs enriched at WT1-bound loci that includes Tead, Lmx1b, Mafb, Tcf21, and Fox-class transcription factors.

(Submitter supplied) Fumarate hydratase (FH) is the enzyme in the Krebs cycle, which transforms fumarate to malate. Loss of fumarate hyrdragase leads to hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC). The biallelic inactivation has been highly accumulated in FH-deficient cells and is considered a major pro-oncogenic factor for HLRCC tumorigenesis. We used microarrays to understand the global readaptation of cell metabolism of gene expression underlying the truncated Krebs cycle by loss of function of fumarate hydratase.

457. Renal cells Carcinoma (RCC) Genome variation profiling by genome tiling array with Perkin Elmer Constituionnal Chip platform
(Submitter supplied) Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the second most frequent renal cell carcinomas (RCC) after clear cell RCC. In contrast to clear cell RCC, there is no consensual protocol using targeted therapy for metastatic pRCC. Moreover, diagnosis of some pRCC, especially pRCC of type 2 (pRCC2) may be challenging. Our aim was to identify molecular biomarkers that could be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of pRCC.

570. The Folliculin-Fnip1 pathway deleted in human Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is required for B cell development.
(Submitter supplied) Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hamartomas of skin follicles, cystic lung disease, and renal neoplasia.  Affected individuals carry heterozygous mutations in Folliculin (FLCN), a tumor suppressor gene that becomes biallelically inactivated in kidney tumors by second-hit mutations. Similar to other factors implicated in kidney malignancies, Folliculin has been shown to modulate activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). more...

571. microRNA expression patterns of lung metastasis samples distinguish patients with high vs. low rates of metastasis
(Submitter supplied) Background: Many strategies to define subtypes and treat cancer relies on a presumption of either localized or widespread (poly)metastatic disease. We proposed an intermediate state of metastasis termed oligometastasis(es) characterized by limited metastatic progression and amenable to treatment by localized methods e.g. surgery or radiotherapy. Methods: To understand the biological basis of oligometastatic and polymetastatic progression, we analyzed microRNA expression patterns from lung tumor samples of patients with less than five metastases at first metastasis presentation and treated with metastasis-directed surgery. more...

608. The use of the glycoarray chip to investigate VHL-dependent protein glycosylation changes in renal cancer Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
(Submitter supplied) Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for around 2-3% of all adult neoplasms and its incidence is increasing. RCC is largely resistant to standard cancer treatment regimens including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, whilst immunotherapy modestly provides benefit to only a small subset of patients. As a result, prognosis for RCC patients with advanced disease is very poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. more...

613. Custom Illumina array DNA methylation analysis of 384 CpGs across five cancer types
(Submitter supplied) Tumor heterogeneity is a major barrier to effective cancer diagnosis and treatment. We recently identified cancer-specific differentially DNA-methylated regions (cDMRs) in colon cancer, which also distinguish normal tissue types from each other. We therefore hypothesized that these colon cDMRs might also be cDMRs for other cancer types. For colon, lung, breast, thyroid, and Wilms tumors, we show stochastic variation in methylation within each tumor type, but involving the same loci across tumor types, with intermediate values of variation for premalignant adenomas.

Background : Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) and renal oncocytoma are two distinct but closely related entities with strong morphologic and genetic similarities.  While chRCC is a malignant tumor, oncocytoma is usually regarded as a benign entity.  The overlapping characteristics are best explained by a common cellular origin, and the biologic differences between chRCC and oncocytoma are therefore of considerable interest in terms of carcinogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management. Previous studies have been relatively limited in terms of examining the differences between oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC. Methods : Gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix HGU133Plus2 platform was applied on chRCC (n=15) and oncocytoma specimens (n=15).  Supervised analysis was applied to identify a discriminatory gene signature, as well as differentially expressed genes.  Immunohistochemical validation was performed in an independent set of tumors. Results : A novel 14 probe-set signature was developed to classify the tumors internally with 93% accuracy, and this was successfully validated on an external data-set with 94% accuracy. Parafibromin, aquaporin 6, and synaptogyrin 3 were novel immunohistochemical markers effectively discriminating the two pathologic entities. Conclusion : Gene expression profiles and pathway analysis effectively distinguish chRCC from oncocytoma. We have generated a novel transcript predictor that is able to discriminate between the two entities accurately, and which has been validated both in an internal and an independent data-set, implying generalizability. We have identified a series of immunohistochemical markers that are clinically useful in discriminating chRCC and oncocytoma.

646. 786-O and 786-VHL in EMCV study
(Submitter supplied) 786-0 is a cell line derived from a clear cell renal carcinoma.  Previous studies have shown that the 786-O cell line harbors an inactivating mutation in the von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene.  Mutations  in the VHL gene occur in the majority of sporadic clear cell renal cell.  To determine how inactivation of the VHL affects cellular functions, we created a derivative of 786-0, which we call 786-VHL in which a functional allele of VHL has been introduced back into the 786-O cell line.

684. Small molecule inhibitors of HIF-2a translation link its 5’-UTR Iron-Responsive Element (IRE) to oxygen sensing 
(Submitter supplied) Cells transiently adapt to hypoxia by globally decreasing protein translation. However, specific proteins needed to respond to hypoxia evade this translational repression. The mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear. We screened for and identified small molecules that selectively decrease HIF-2a translation in an mTOR independent manner, by enhancing the binding of Iron Regulatory Protein 1 (IRP1) to a recently reported Iron-Responsive Element (IRE) within the 5’-untranslated region (UTR) of the HIF-2a message. more...
