1. The secretome of skin cancer cells activates the mTOR/MYC pathway in healthy keratinocytes and converts them into tumorigenic cells
(Submitter supplied) Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most aggressive tumor among non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), showing a high potential for local invasion and metastasis. In recent years, the incidence of cSCC has increased tremendously due to increased UV exposure. The secretome of cancer cells is currently the focus of many studies in order to identify new marker proteins for different types of cancer and to investigate its influence on the tumor microenvironment. more...

2. UVB drives different stages of epigenome alterations during progression of skin cancer [Bisulfite-seq]
(Submitter supplied) Exposure to UVB irradiation results in multitude of cellular responses including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage and is responsible for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Although genetic mutation is well documented, the epi-mutation, the alteration in epigenetics, remains elusive. DNA methylation is a stable and heritable epigenetic change in the control of gene expression. more...

5. Molecular classification of non-melanoma skin cancer by gene expression profiling
(Submitter supplied) Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are more common kinds of skin cancer. Although these tumors share common pathological and clinical features, their similarity and heterogeneity at molecular levels are not fully elaborated yet. Here, by performing comparative analysis of gene expression profiling of BCC, SCC, and normal skin tissues, we could classify the BCC into three subtypes of classical, SCC-like, and normal-like BCCs. more...

6. Novel Immunotherapy-Induced Tertiary Lymphoid Aggregates Accumulate as Intratumoral Nodal Structures of Immune Regulation in Pancreatic Cancer
(Submitter supplied) Immunotherapy provides an alternative approach for cancer treatment.  However, in-depth analyses of the effects of immunotherapy on the tumor microenvironment (TME) have not been conducted in non-melanoma tumors. Here we describe changes in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) TME following immunotherapy treatment, and show for the first time that vaccine-based immunotherapy directly alters the TME, inducing neogenesis of tertiary lymphoid structures that convert immunologically quiescent tumors into immunologically active tumors. more...

Methods: mRNA profiles of tumor cell lines (SK-Mel-28, UACC-62, HCT-116) stably expressing scrambled shRNA or RAB7 shRNA (harvested at day 3 after lentiviral infection) were generated by deep sequencing, using three biological replicates per condition. more...

8. Intense THz pulses down-regulate genes associated with skin cancer and psoriasis: a new therapeutic avenue?
(Submitter supplied) We show that exposure of artificial human skin tissue to intense, picosecond-duration THz pulses affects expression levels of numerous genes associated with non-melanoma skin cancers, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Genes affected by intense THz pulses include nearly half of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) members. EDC genes, which are mapped to the chromosomal human region 1q21, encode for proteins that partake in epidermal differentiation and are often overexpressed in conditions such as psoriasis and skin cancer. more...

9. Spontaneous SCC induced by the somatic inactivation of Rb1 and Trp53 tumor suppressors in mouse stratified epithelia
(Submitter supplied) The squamous cell carcinomas represent the aggressive type of non melanoma skin cancer, the most frequent malignancy among human population. We have studied here the possible relationship between these two pathways in skin using epidermal-specific mutant mice. Loss of p53, but not pRb, produces spontaneous tumor development, indicating that, contrary to pRb, p53 is the predominant tumor suppressor acting in mouse epidermis. more...

10. Novel Molecular Markers for non-melanoma skin cancer
(Submitter supplied) normal skin (no), actinic keratosis (ak), and squamous cell carcinoma (scc) of the skin were examined:   Carcinogenesis is a multi-step process indicated by several genes up- or down-regulated during tumor progression. The type and number of genes involved in non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) are still unclear. This study examined and identified different expressed genes in NMSC. Fifteen snap-frozen biopsies of five immunosuppressed organ-transplanted recipients each normal skin, actinic keratosis (AK) and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were analysed. more...

12. Whole-genome expression profiling of melanoma progression.
(Submitter supplied) To gain insights into the genetic profile of every stage of the melanoma progression pathway, and to determine to what extent these profiles are similar or distinct, we performed whole-genome expression profiling of tissue specimens representing normal skin, benign and atypical nevi, and early and advanced-stage melanomas. The results of this study provide first-time evidence that significant molecular changes occur distinctly at the border of/transition from melanoma in situ to primary melanoma, and that genes involved in mitotic cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation constitute the two leading categories of genes associated with these changes. more...
