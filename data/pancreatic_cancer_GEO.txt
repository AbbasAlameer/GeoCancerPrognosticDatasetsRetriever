1. Muscle and adipose transcriptome in a mouse model of cachexia induced by orthotopic pancreatic cancer, with and without tumor-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6)
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) causes involuntary wasting of adipose and muscle tissue, also known as cachexia. Cachexia is a major cause of cancer-related deaths, particularly among patients with PDAC. Here we profiled gene expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in normal/sham control mice and in mice bearing orthotopic PDAC tumors.  PDAC tumors were initiated by intra-pancreatic injection of a cell line derived from the KPC (Kras-G12D;Trp-R172H;Pdx1::Cre) genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer, or by injection of the same cell line deleted for the IL6 gene using CRISPR/Cas9. more...

3. Type 2 immunity is maintained during cancer associated adipose tissue wasting
(Submitter supplied) Purpose: Cachexia is a metabolic phenotype affecting many cancer patients. The immune environment in adipose tissue during the development of cancer associated cachexia has not been characterized. To help address this gap, we isolated visceral adipose tissue from cancer-bearing and sham-operated mice and performed bulk RNA-sequencing. Methods: mRNA expression was evaluated by RNA-sequencing in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of 10-week old mice which had been subjected to sham surgery (sham) or had received orthotopic pancreatic tumors four weeks prior to harvest (KPC). more...

4. Sulfopin, a covalent inhibitor of Pin1, blocks Myc-driven tumors in vivo
(Submitter supplied) The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin1, is exploited in cancer to activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressors. However, despite considerable efforts, Pin1 has remained an elusive drug target. Here, we screened an electrophilic fragment library to identify covalent inhibitors targeting Pin1’s active site Cys113, leading to the development of Sulfopin, a nanomolar Pin1 inhibitor. Sulfopin is highly selective, as validated by two independent chemoproteomics methods, achieves potent cellular and in vivo target engagement, and phenocopies Pin1 genetic knockout. more...

35. STIM1 Mediates Calcium-dependent Epigenetic Reprogramming in Pancreatic Cancer [mRNAseq_Par_GemR]
(Submitter supplied) We characterized Gemcitabine resistant pancreatic cancer tumors and show that the co-amplification of RRM1 and STIM1 confers novel and independent properties to gemcitabine resistant cells. The upregulation of RRM1 drives gemcitabine resistance, while the amplification of STIM1 leads to increased cytosolic calcium upon stress, eliciting ER stress resistance and NFAT activation.

41. Preservation of MYBBP1A at the chromatin in MYBBP1A hemizygous cells
(Submitter supplied) MYB Binding:    Protein 1 A (MYBBP1A) is hemizygous in a majority of PDAC due to chromosome 17p deletion  which also affects TP53. We generated isogenic homozygous and hemizygous MYBBP1A  knockout cell lines to elucidate MYBBP1A function in cancer. As the function of MYBBP1A at the chromatin is unclear, we performed MYBBP1A ChIPseq in MYBBP1A wild-type and hemizygous cells. Surprisingly, despite the hemizygous cells expressing decreased MYBBP1A expression, the whole genome binding profile is largely similar compared to MYBBP1A wild-type cells.

69. The role of NTS/NTSR1 signal in pancreatic cancer progression
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic cancer is one of the uncurable cancers and 5-year survival rate is still under 10 %. Therefore, it is urgent to identify a new molecular target for cure. In this study, the mouse serial transplantations by pancreatic orthotopic inoculation model were utilized for screening of new targets. The gene expression of highly malignant cancer cell lines, established in our previous study, showed increased expression of neurotensin receptor-1 (NTSR1). more...

70. Secretory mucin 5AC promotes neoplastic progression by augmenting KLF4-mediated pancreatic cancer cell stemness
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the third deadliest malignancy with a dismal five-year survival rate. The KrasG12D initiator mutation, present in 95% of the PC patients, leads to the development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). The PanIN lesions, the most common precursor lesion of PC, exhibit de novo expression of mucins, which significantly contributes to PC pathobiology. The poor clinical outcome of PC warrants the identification of molecular player(s) that facilitate the progression of Kras-driven precursor lesions to invasive ductal carcinoma. more...

73. Transcriptome reprogramming of CD11b+ bone marrow cells by pancreatic cancer extracellular vesicles
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic cancers (PC) are highly metastatic with poor prognosis, mainly due to delayed detection. We previously showed that PC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) act on macrophages residing in the liver, preparing pre-metastatic niches that support metastasis to this organ. This process involves the binding of PC-EVs to Kupffer cells, followed by TGFβ secretion and upregulation of fibronectin production by hepatic stellate cells, which supports hepatic accumulation of CD11b+ bone marrow (BM) cells and PC liver metastasis. more...

Despite numerous theoretical and experimental efforts, therapeutic approaches targeting pancreatic cancer stroma have been largely unsuccessful, highlighting the need for more comprehensive assessment of inter- and intratumoral stromal heterogeneity in a large series of clinical tumors.  Quantitative computation of FAP-dominant fibroblasts, ACTA2-dominant fibroblasts, and intratumoral collagen in whole-tissue sections from 215 treatment-naïve pancreatic cancers allowed us to identify three distinct stroma types (FAP-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma [F-stroma], ACTA2-dominant fibroblast-rich stroma [A-stroma], and collgen-rich stroma [C-stroma]), which were differentially associated with patient outcomes, molecular characteristics and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. more...

102. Detection of early stage pancreatic cancer using 5-hydroxymethylcytosine signatures in circulating cell free DNA
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic cancers are typically diagnosed at late stage where disease prognosis is poor as exemplified by a 5-year survival rate of 10%. Earlier diagnosis would be beneficial by enabling surgical resection or earlier application of therapeutic regimens.  We investigated non-invasive detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by interrogating changes in 5-hydroxymethylation cytosines (5hmC) of circulating cell free DNA in the plasma of a PDAC cohort (n=64) in comparison with a non-cancer cohort (n=243). more...

134. Arsenic is more potent than cadmium or manganese in disrupting the INS-1 beta cell microRNA landscape
(Submitter supplied) Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by fasting hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. Laboratory and population studies have shown that inorganic arsenic (iAs) can impair these pathways. Other metals including cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) have also been linked to diabetes phenotypes. MicroRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, have emerged as potential drivers of metabolic dysfunction. more...

136. Glutamine depletion regulates Slug to promote EMT and metastasis in pancreatic cancer [mouse]
(Submitter supplied) Tumor cells rely on glutamine to fulfill their metabolic demands and sustain proliferation. The elevated consumption of glutamine can lead to intratumoral nutrient depletion, causing metabolic stress that has the potential to impact tumor progression. Here, we show that nutrient stress caused by glutamine deprivation leads to the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. more...

138. Functional characterization of the novel GWAS-identified GP2 coding variant
(Submitter supplied) In a meta-analysis of three GWASs in the Japanese population, we identified a novel locus at 16p12.3 significantly associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility. A series of experiments were performed to explore the functional impact of the nonsynonymous lead SNP rs78193826 of the GP2 gene at 16p12.3 on global gene expression. Based on CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutation, RNA-seq, and GSEA analyses, we demonstrated that the functional relevance of rs78193826 may involve modulation of KRAS activity.

142. The transcriptional profile of neutrophils in different organs during pancreatic cancer
(Submitter supplied) It was previously demonstrated that myeloid cells assume a distinct transcriptional profile when infiltrating the brain during chronic inflammation. We demonstrated that neutrophils infiltrate the brain during pancreatic cancer. To determine if the transcriptional profile of brain-infiltrating neutrophils is distinct from those infiltrating other organs, we compared the gene signatures of brain-infiltrating neutrophils, circulating neutrophils, liver-infiltrating neutrophils, and tumor-infiltrating neutrophils to that of circulating neutrophils from healthy mice.

143. SETD5-coordinated chromatin reprogramming regulates adaptive resistance to targeted pancreatic cancer therapy
(Submitter supplied) Oncogenic KRAS signaling is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal malignancy with few treatment options. A major roadblock in deploying therapies targeting the KRAS-MAPK pathway is the rapid emergence of resistant cancer cells. However, molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive targeted therapy resistance in PDAC are poorly understood. Here we find SETD5 (SET domain containing 5) as a major epigenetic driver of PDAC resistance to MEK1/2 inhibition (MEKi). more...

(Submitter supplied) Gemcitabine (GEM) alone and GEM-based chemotherapy are the preferred regimens for treating advanced unresectable and metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC). However, these treatments have limited efficacy due to acquired resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy, the mechanisms of which are not fully understood. In this study, we established two GEM-resistant cell lines (BxPC-3-GR and CFPAC-1-GR) and compared the expression profiles of mRNAs between parental (BxPC-3 and CFPAC-1) and GEM-resistant cells by high-throughput RNA sequencing, and to identify potential targets for GEM response in PC patients.

188. Senescence-induced vascular remodeling creates therapeutic vulnerabilities in pancreas cancer 
(Submitter supplied) KRAS mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a desmoplastic response that promotes hypovascularity, immunosuppression, and resistance to chemo- and immunotherapies. We show that a combination of MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors that target KRAS-directed oncogenic signaling can suppress PDAC proliferation through induction of retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated senescence. In preclinical mouse models of PDAC, this senescence-inducing therapy produces a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that includes pro-angiogenic factors that promote tumor vascularization, which in turn enhances drug delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic gemcitabine chemotherapy. more...

Of great puzzle is the lack of induction of corresponding piRNAs in cancer cells, as we document here in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), implying that such germline-specific proteins are somehow hijacked to promote tumorigenesis through different mode of action. more...

(Submitter supplied) Intra-tumor hypoxia is a common feature in many solid cancers. Although transcriptional targets of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have been well characterized, alternative splicing or processing of pre-mRNA transcripts which occurs during hypoxia and subsequent HIF stabilization is much less understood. Here, we identify HIF-dependent alternative splicing events after whole transcriptome sequencing in pancreatic cancer cells exposed to hypoxia with and without downregulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), a protein required for HIFs to form a transcriptionally active dimer.

272. Cell cycle plasticity driven by MTOR signaling: integral mechanism for resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), like many KRAS-driven tumors, preferentially loses CDKN2A to bypass the RB tumor suppressive pathway.   This finding and a gene expression profile indicative of a CDK4/6-driven cell cycle suggests that PDAC could be particularly sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition.   Analysis of a panel of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts indicates that many pancreatic cancers have an intrinsic resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition that is not due to known molecular mechanisms. more...

Epigenetic modifications involving both DNA methylation and histone modification have a relationship between tumor initiation and progression. However, the contribution of histone variants in the PDAC is unknown.

Familial predisposition to PDAC occurs in ~10% of cases, but causative genes have not been identified in most families. Uncovering the genetic basis for PDAC susceptibility has immediate prognostic implications for families and can provide mechanistic clues to PDAC pathogenesis. Here, we perform whole-genome sequence analysis in a family with multiple cases of PDAC and identify a germline nonsense mutation in the member of RAS oncogene family-like 3 (RABL3) gene never before directly associated with hereditary cancer. more...

294. Gene expression changes in tumor following ADH-503 treatment
(Submitter supplied) To understand the effect of ADH-503, we have employed microarray expression profiling to identify genes that change at different times 48hrs and 10 days after treatment initiation.   CD11b/18 (alphaMbeta2), an integrin molecule is highly expressed on all myeloid cells and plays an important role in transendothelial migration and functional changes in these cells. Here we demonstrate that a small molecule agonist of CD11b, ADH-503 was associated reprograming tumor immunity by promoting anti-tumor immune cell populations by enhancing antigen presentation by macrophages and cDCs and together these changes resulted in stabilization of tumor growth and improvement in overall survival.

304. GLP-1 signaling suppresses menin's transcriptional block by phosphorylation in beta cells
(Submitter supplied) We find that GLP-1 signaling-activated PKA directly phosphorylates menin at serine 487 residue, relieving menin mediated suppression of insulin expression in beta cells and islets of diabetic GK rat. Mechanistically, GLP-1-induced PKA activation leads to menin Ser487 phosphorylation, and phosphorylated menin gains increased binding affinity to cytoskeleton proteins such as beta actin and myosin. Sequestration of Ser487 phosphorylated menin from the Ins1 gene promoter leads to reduced binding of menin-associating repressive epigenetic regulators such as SUV39H1 and HDAC1 at the locus, resulting in increased Ins1 transcription. more...

341. Mutant p53R270H drives altered metabolism and increased invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic cancer is characterized by nearly universal activating mutations in KRAS. Among other somatic mutations, TP53 is mutated in more than 75% of human pancreatic tumors. Genetically engineered mice have proven instrumental in studies of the contribution of individual genes to carcinogenesis. Oncogenic Kras mutations occur early during pancreatic carcinogenesis and are considered an initiating event. more...

489. Therapeutic vulnerabilities of mesenchymal subpopulations of pancreatic cancer cells undergoing anabolic reprogramming [set 1]
(Submitter supplied) Malignant neoplasms adapt and evolve in response to changes in oncogenic signaling, tumor microenvironmental stresses,and therapeutic interventions. Cancer cell plasticity in response to these evolutionary pressures is foundational to tumor progression and maintenance and therapeutic resistance. Here, to elucidate the underlying molecular and cellularmechanisms of cancer cell plasticity, integrated system-level, functional and genetic analyses were conducted in a conditional oncogenic Kras model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), amalignancy displaying remarkable phenotypic diversityand morphological heterogeneity. more...

490. Autocrine IGF1 signaling mediates pancreatic tumor cell dormancy in the absence of oncogenic drivers
(Submitter supplied) Mutant KRAS and c-MYC are oncogenic drivers and rational therapeutic targets for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. While tumor growth and homeostasis is largely dependent on these oncogenes, a few residual cancer cells are able to survive the ablation of mutant KRAS and c-MYC. By performing a genome-wide gene expression analysis of in vivo-derived bulk tumor cells and residual cancer cells lacking the expression of mutant KRAS or c-MYC, we have identified an increase in autocrine IGF1/AKT signaling as a common survival mechanism in dormant cancer cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is a premalignant lesion that can progress to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a highly lethal malignancy marked by its late stage at clinical presentation and profound drug resistance. Here we developed novel fluorescent reporter mice that show that the stem cell determinant, Musashi (Msi) is a critical element of pancreatic cancer progression. These reporters allowed functional and image based tracking of stem cell signals within cancers in vivo, revealing that Msi expression rises as PanINs progress to adenocarcinoma, and that Msi reporter+ tumor cells are the key drivers of pancreatic cancer.

566. Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma contains a side population resistant to gemcitabine
(Submitter supplied) BACKGROUND: Therapy resistance remains one of the major challenges to improve the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. Chemoresistant cells, which potentially also display cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics, can be isolated using the side population (SP) technique. Our aim was to search for a SP in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and to examine its chemoresistance and CSC phenotype. more...

(Submitter supplied) We have shown that increased β-cell proliferation in functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (insulinomas) correlated with expression of phosphorylated isoform of the transcription factor HLXB9 which is an embryonic beta-cell differentiation factor (HLXB9 is also known as HB9, MNR2, and MNX1). To investigate  the  target genes of phospho-HLXB9 we did  ChIP-seq using anti-HB9-PO4. This would help us better understand how phospho-HLXB9 regulates its targets and affects β-cell proliferation in insulinoma cells.

581. Annexin A2 controls pancreatic cancer invasion and metastasis through a novel axon guidance pathway
(Submitter supplied) The mechanisms involved in promoting metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have yet to be elucidated. Here, we show that AnnexinA2 regulates the secretion of Semaphorin3D from pancreatic tumor cells allowing it to bind to its receptor PlexinD1 on the surface of the tumor cell, which induces invasion and metastasis. Knockdown of AnnexinA2 or Semaphorin3D decreases the metastatic potential of pancreatic tumor cells, while over expression of AnnexinA2 or Semaphorin3D is sufficient to rescue the invasion capacity of these cells. more...

583. Slug-dependent upregulation of L1CAM is responsible for the increased invasion potential of pancreatic cancer cells following long-term 5-FU-treatment
(Submitter supplied) In pancreatic cancer the survival rate is low, as the available treatment options usually only extend survival and seldom produce a cure. Drug resistance and disease reoccurrence is the typical reason for death after cancer diagnosis. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the main chemostatic used in first line therapy.  However the majority of the tumors become resistant to treatment. To investigate acquired 5-FU resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, we established chemoresistant monoclonal cell lines from the Panc03.27 cell line by long-term exposure to 5-FU. more...

(Submitter supplied) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with accumulation of particular oncogenic mutations and recent genetic sequencing studies have identified ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) mutations in PDAC cohorts. Here we report that conditional deletion of ATM in a mouse model of PDAC induces a greater number of proliferative precursor lesions coupled with a pronounced fibrotic reaction. ATM-targeted mice display altered TGFβ-superfamily signalling and enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) coupled with shortened survival. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cohesin, which consists of SMC1, SMC3, Rad21 and either SA1 or SA2, topologically embraces the chromatin fibers to hold sister chromatids together and to stabilize chromatin loops. Increasing evidence indicates that these loops are the organizing principle of higher-order chromatin architecture, which in turn is critical for gene expression. To determine how cohesin contributes to the establishment of tissue-specific transcriptional programs, we compared genome-wide cohesin distribution, gene expression and chromatin architecture in cerebral cortex and pancreas from adult mice. more...

These markers have been investigated in a variety of cancer settings for their utility in differentiating normal tissue from tumor tissue.  Here, we examine the direct correlation between DNA methylation and patient survival.  We find that changes in the DNA methylation of key pancreatic developmental genes is strongly associated with patient survival.

Importantly, in most cases rather than a simple loss of function p53 mutation, point mutations of p53 accumulate at the protein level and may have dominant negative functions. This study analyses gene expression differences between mice harbouring p53 mutation who do and do not develop metastasis.

We hypothesized that intercellular communication is critical for metastatic progression. Here, we show that PC-derived exosomes induce liver pre-metastatic niche formation in naïve mice and consequently increase liver metastatic burden.

601. Gene expression in Galectin-3 KO vs. WT CD8 T cells
(Submitter supplied) The goal of this study was to examine differences in gene expression of tumor specific CD8 T cells in an in vivo tumor mouse model after inhibition of galectin-3 protein expression by genetic knockout.  Galectin-3 is thought to modulate CD8 T cell response by cross-linking cell surface glycoproteins Galectin-3 is a 31 kD carbohydrate-binding lectin that is over-expressed by many human malignancies.  It also modulates T cell responses through a diverse array of mechanisms including induction of apoptosis, TCR cross linking in CD8+ T cells, and T cell receptor (TCR) down regulation in CD4+ T cells.      We found that patients responding to a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secreting allogeneic pancreatic tumor vaccine developed post immunization antibody responses to galectin-3 on a proteomic screen.  We used the HER-2/neu (neu-N) transgenic mouse model to study galectin-3 binding on adoptively transferred high avidity neu-specific CD8+ T cells derived from TCR transgenic mice.  Here, we show that galectin-3 binds preferentially to activated antigen-committed CD8+ T cells only in the tumor microenvironment (TME).  Galectin-3 deficient mice exhibit improved CD8+ T cell effector function and increased expression of several inflammatory genes when compared with wild type (WT) mice.  We also show that galectin-3 binds to LAG-3, and LAG-3 expression is necessary for galectin-3 mediated suppression of CD8+ T cells in vitro.  Lastly, galectin-3 deficient mice have significantly elevated levels of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are superior to conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in activating CD8+ T cells.    Binding of galectin-3 to cell-surface glycoproteins on immune cells suppresses a pro-inflammatory immune response.  Thus, inhibiting galectin-3 in conjunction with CD8+ T cell directed immunotherapies should enhance the tumor specific immune response.

(Submitter supplied) Cytokines have been shown to play a key role in the destruction of beta cells. In the rat insulinoma cell line (INS-1ab) overexpressing pancreatic duodenum homeobox 1 (Pdx1) increases sensitivity to Interleukin 1b (IL-1b). To elucidate mechanisms of action underlying Pdx1 driven potentiation of beta-cell sensitivity to IL-1β, we performed a microarray analysis of INS-1ab cells with and without Pdx1 overexpression exposed to IL-1β between 2h and 24h.

777. Kras is required for pancreatic tumor maintenance through regulation of hexosamine biosynthesis and the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway
(Submitter supplied) The maintenance of advanced malignancies relies on continued activity of driver oncogenes, although their rate-limiting role is highly context-dependent with respect to tumor types and associated genetic alterations.  Oncogenic Kras mutation is the signature event in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), serving a critical role in tumor initiation.  Here, an inducible KrasG12D-driven p53 mutant PDAC mouse model establishes that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on continued KrasG12D expression and that KrasG12D serves a vital role in the control of tumor metabolism, through stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). more...

A deeper understanding of the underlying molecular pathophysiology is expected to advance the urgent need to develop novel therapeutic and early detection strategies for this disease. Genomic characterisation of PC has previously relied on targeted PCR based exome sequencing of small cohorts of mixed primary and metastatic lesions propagated as xenografts or cell lines (Jones et al, Science 321:1801-1806), leaving the true mutational spectrum of the clinical disease largely unresolved. more...

This therapy relies on efficient replication of virus in tumor cells in vivo with minimal or no replication in normal tissues. We recently described GLV-1h68 as a modified Vaccinia Virus (VACV) construct with exclusive in vivo tropism for tumor cells in experimental animal models. Moreover, we had previously observed a cell line-specific relationship between the ability of GLV-1h68 to replicate in vitro during the first 20 hours following infection and the in vivo ability to colonize and eliminate the corresponding tumor implant. more...

(Submitter supplied) INTRODUCTION. Fixation with formalin, a widely adopted procedure to preserve tissue samples, leads to extensive degradation of nucleic acids and thereby compromises procedures like microarray-based gene expression profiling. We hypothesized that RNA fragmentation is caused by activation of RNAses during the interval between formalin penetration and tissue fixation. To prevent RNAse activation, a series of tissue samples were kept under-vacuum at 4°C until fixation and then fixed at 4°C, for 24 hours, in formalin followed by 4 hours in ethanol 95%. more...

872. A gene expression signature associated with K-Ras addiction reveals regulators of EMT and tumor cell survival
(Submitter supplied) K-Ras mutations occur frequently in epithelial cancers. Using shRNAs to deplete K-Ras in lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines harboring K-Ras mutations, two classes were identified—lines that do or do not require K-Ras to maintain viability.  Comparing these two classes of cancer cells revealed a gene expression signature in K-Ras-dependent cells, associated with a well-differentiated epithelial phenotype, which was also seen in primary tumors. more...
