# geo_CPDR
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): Cancer Prognostic Datasets Retriever (or geo_CPDR) is a Bioinformatics tool for cancer prognostic dataset retrieval from the GEO database. It requires a GeoDatasets input file listing all GSE dataset entries for a specific cancer (ex. Bladder cancer), obtained as a download from the GEO database.  geo_CPDR functions by applying two heuristic filters to examine individual GSE dataset entries listed in a GEO DataSets input file. The first filter (Prognostic title/abstract filter) flags for prognostic keywords (ex. “prognosis” or “survival”) used by clinical science researchers and present in the title/abstract entries of a GSE dataset. If found, geo_CPDR retrieves those flagged datasets. The second filter (Prognostic Signature filter) filters these datasets further by applying prognostic signature pattern matching (Perl regular expression signatures) to identify if the GSE dataset is a likely prognostic dataset.
