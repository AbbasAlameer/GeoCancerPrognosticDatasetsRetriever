3. Identification of distinct immune subtypes in colorectal cancer based on stroma compartment
(Submitter supplied) Tumor environment is of vital importance for the incidence and development of colorectal cancer. In order to decipher tumor environment feature of colorectal cancer and explore the role of its immune context composition in cancer classification, we performed gene expression microarray on microdissection processed stroma compartments of colorectal cancer and adjacent normal tissues. Integrated analysis of our data with public gene expression microarray data of microdissection processed stromal and epithelial tissues of colorectal, we identified three immune subtypes — active immune, active stroma and mixed type. more...

4. Differential clinicopathological and molecular features within late-onset colorectal cancer according to tumor location
(Submitter supplied) Background: Since there is a predilection of some clinical and molecular features for a given tumor location, we assessed whether this can be confirmed in late-onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC).

7. miRNA and colorectal cancer:  associations with tumor phenotype and survival
(Submitter supplied) MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs.  Data suggest the importance of miRNAs to cancer development and possibly to survival.  Our overall hypothesis is that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). more...

To better define the origin of such transcripts, we analyzed  RNAseq and microarray datasets from CRC mouse xenografts, where human cancer cells are supported by murine stroma. The analysis revealed that mRNA levels of stem/serrated subtype genes are mostly due to stromal expression, even when the stromal fraction is below 5%. more...
